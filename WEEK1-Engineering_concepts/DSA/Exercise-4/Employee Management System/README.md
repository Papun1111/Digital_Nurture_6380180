## Exercise 4: Employee Management System

### Scenario

You are developing an employee management system for a company. Efficiently managing employee records is crucial.

---

### 1. Understand Array Representation

Arrays are a linear data structure stored in contiguous memory locations. Each element in the array can be accessed directly using its index, which allows for constant time access. This makes arrays efficient for fixed-size collections where rapid access is required.

**Advantages of Arrays:**

* Constant-time access to elements using index
* Simple to use and implement
* Efficient for iteration and fixed-size datasets

---

### 2. Setup

An `Employee` class is created with the following attributes:

* `employeeId` (immutable identifier)
* `name` (String)
* `position` (String)
* `salary` (double)

---

### 3. Implementation

The main logic is implemented using a static array of `Employee` objects. The system demonstrates the following operations:

* **Add** an employee to the array
* **Search** for an employee by ID
* **Traverse** all employee records
* **Delete** an employee by ID

Each operation is demonstrated with a single hardcoded example in `Main.java`.

### 4. Analysis

**Time Complexity:**

* Add: O(1) (amortized if there's space)
* Search: O(n)
* Traverse: O(n)
* Delete: O(n) due to shifting elements

**Limitations of Arrays:**

* Fixed size at declaration
* Inefficient for dynamic insertions or deletions
* Manual memory and index management required

**When to Use Arrays:**

* When the number of elements is known and fixed
* When random access is required frequently
* For performance-critical scenarios with minimal insertions/deletions
