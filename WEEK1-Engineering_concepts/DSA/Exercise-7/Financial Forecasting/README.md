# Financial Forecasting Tool

## Overview

This project implements a financial forecasting tool in Java that predicts future values using a recursive algorithm. The prediction is based on a starting amount, a growth rate, and the number of years to forecast.

---

## 1. Understanding Recursive Algorithms

Recursion is a programming approach where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems. It helps simplify problems that involve repetitive computations, such as financial projections, by reducing the problem to a base case and solving the rest recursively.

---

## 2. Setup

A `Forecast` class is used to encapsulate the input values:

* `currentValue`: the current financial value
* `growthRate`: the annual percentage increase
* `futureYears`: the number of years to forecast

The `Main` class contains the recursive method to calculate the future value using this data.

---

## 3. Implementation

The `predictFutureValue(Forecast obj)` method is implemented recursively. It multiplies the current value by `(1 + growthRate)` each year and reduces the number of years by one until it reaches zero. At that point, the future value is returned.

### Sample Usage

```java
Forecast obj = new Forecast(1234, 0.05, 5);
double result = predictFutureValue(obj);
System.out.println("Predicted Future Value: " + result);
```

## 4. Analysis

### Time Complexity

The recursive method has a linear time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of years. This is because the method makes one recursive call for each year.

### Optimization

While recursion simplifies the logic, it also consumes stack memory. For large inputs, this may lead to stack overflow. To optimise:

* Convert the logic to an iterative approach
* Avoid modifying the input object directly to maintain immutability
* Use memoization if the calculation involves overlapping subproblems

---

## How to Run

1. Place both `Forecast.java` and `Main.java` in the same directory.
2. Compile and run the program:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

## Files

* `Forecast.java`: Holds the financial input parameters.
* `Main.java`: Contains the recursive prediction logic and the entry point of the program.
