# Task Management System

## Overview

This project implements a simple Task Management System using a **Singly Linked List** to manage tasks. The system supports basic operations such as adding, searching, traversing, and deleting tasks efficiently.

---

## 1. Understanding Linked Lists

### Singly Linked List

A singly linked list consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node. It allows efficient insertion and deletion from the beginning or middle of the list.

### Doubly Linked List

A doubly linked list contains nodes with references to both the next and previous nodes. It allows traversal in both directions but requires more memory per node.

---

## 2. Setup

### Task Class

The `Task` class includes:

* `taskId`: an integer representing the unique ID of the task.
* `taskName`: a string containing the name of the task.
* `status`: a boolean indicating whether the task is completed or pending.

### Node and LinkedList

* The `Node` class wraps a `Task` object and a pointer to the next node.
* The `LinkedList` class manages the head and tail nodes and provides methods to manipulate the task list.

---

## 3. Implementation

### Core Methods

* **add(Task task)**: Adds a new task to the end of the list.
* **traverse()**: Displays all tasks in the list with their ID, name, and status.
* **search(int taskId)**: Searches for a task by ID and prints its location.
* **delete(int taskId)**: Deletes a task with the specified ID, handling head and tail cases.

### Example Usage in `Main.java`

```java
LinkedList taskList = new LinkedList();

taskList.add(new Task(1, "Finish Assignment", false));
taskList.add(new Task(2, "Attend Meeting", true));
taskList.add(new Task(3, "Workout", false));

taskList.traverse();

taskList.search(2);
taskList.delete(2);
taskList.traverse();
```

## 4. Analysis

### Time Complexity

* **Add**: O(1) (insertion at the end using tail reference)
* **Search**: O(n)
* **Traverse**: O(n)
* **Delete**: O(n)

### Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays

* **Dynamic Size**: Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require pre-allocated size and grow dynamically.
* **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Inserting or deleting elements (especially in the middle) is faster as it does not require shifting elements like in arrays.
* **Memory Efficiency**: Memory allocation is done as needed, avoiding wastage seen in over-sized arrays.

---

## Files

* `Task.java`: Defines the Task class.
* `Main.java`: Contains the `Node`, `LinkedList`, and `Main` classes for execution and logic.

## How to Run

Compile all Java files in the same directory:

```bash
javac *.java  
java Main
```
