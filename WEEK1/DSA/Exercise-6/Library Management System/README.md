# Library Management System

## Overview

This project implements a Library Management System where users can search for books by title or author using both linear and binary search algorithms. The system is built using Java and stores books in an `ArrayList`.

---

## 1. Understanding Search Algorithms

### Linear Search

Linear search sequentially checks each element in the list until the desired element is found. It works on unsorted data but has slower performance for large datasets.

### Binary Search

Binary search repeatedly divides the sorted list in half to locate the target element. It is efficient but requires the list to be sorted based on the search attribute.

---

## 2. Setup

### Book Class

The `Book` class contains the following attributes:

* `bookId`: A unique integer identifier for each book.
* `title`: The title of the book.
* `author`: The name of the author.

---

## 3. Implementation

### Methods

* `linearSearch(ArrayList<Book> books, String author, String title)`
  Searches the book list linearly and prints the hashCode if the title or author matches.

* `binarySearchByTitle(ArrayList<Book> books, String title)`
  Performs binary search on the list sorted by title and returns the index if found.

* `binarySearchByAuthor(ArrayList<Book> books, String author)`
  Performs binary search on the list sorted by author and returns the index if found.

### Example Usage

The `main` method creates a list of books, adds sample entries, sorts the list as needed, and performs search operations using both methods.

## 4. Analysis

### Time Complexity

| Algorithm     | Time Complexity | Requirements         |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Linear Search | O(n)            | No sorting required  |
| Binary Search | O(log n)        | Requires sorted list |

### When to Use

* **Linear Search** is suitable for small or unsorted datasets and quick lookups.
* **Binary Search** is optimal for large, sorted datasets where fast lookup is essential.

## How to Run

1. Place both `Book.java` and `Main.java` in the same directory.
2. Compile and run using the following commands:

   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```

---

## Files

* `Book.java`: Defines the book structure.
* `Main.java`: Contains logic for search and test execution.
