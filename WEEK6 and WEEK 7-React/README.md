# Week 6 & 7 – React Hands-On Assignments

This folder contains all **18 React-based hands-on assignments** completed during **Week 6 and Week 7** of the Digital Nurture 4.0 program.

## Contents

Each of the 18 assignments is organised in its own dedicated folder:

- `1.React HOL`  
- `2.React HOL`  
- `3.React HOL`  
- ...  
- `18.React HOL`

Each folder includes:

- ✅ Source code written using modern React (with JSX, ES6+ standards)  
- ✅ Functional components, hooks (where required), props, and state management  
- ✅ Code structured and formatted according to industry best practices  
- ✅ Output (screenshots or HTML previews) showing the successful execution of each assignment  
- ✅ Proper folder structure separating logic, components, and assets where necessary  

## Objectives Covered

Over the course of these assignments, the following concepts were applied and demonstrated:

- React component creation (functional and class-based)
- Props and State handling
- Conditional rendering
- List rendering using `.map()`
- Forms and controlled components
- React Hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`)
- Event handling in React
- Component lifecycle methods
- Modular and reusable component structure
- Styling using CSS Modules / inline styles
- Debugging and testing basic React logic
- Output verification included for every assignment

## Standards Followed

- ✅ Clean and readable JSX  
- ✅ Component-based architecture  
- ✅ Logical folder and file separation  
- ✅ Reusability and maintainability considered  
- ✅ Each assignment tested and verified locally  
- ✅ Compatible with `create-react-app` environment

> **Note:** All assignments have been completed as per the requirements laid out in the hands-on tasks. Each solution reflects a practical understanding of modern React development aligned with real-world expectations.
